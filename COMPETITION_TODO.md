- **Database Integration**: All competition tables created and connected
- **User Authentication**: Protected routes and proper auth integration
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types throughout
- **Error Handling**: Proper error states and user feedback
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading experiences
- **Code Quality**: All linting and type checking passed

### üéØ **Next Priority: AI Player System**
The foundation is complete. The next logical step is implementing the AI player system to:
1. Fill empty spots in divisions
2. Provide competition for human players
3. Handle promotion/relegation balance
4. Manage human player replacement of AI players

### üèÅ **Race Implementation Notes**

**Future Race Implementation:**
- Specific race locations will be implemented after competition system is complete
- Race commentary will use LLM for engaging updates every 2 minutes
- Races are pre-calculated but presented as real-time with commentary
- Players won't know outcomes are pre-determined

**Race Schedule:**
- Wednesday 08:00: Regional races (adult + youth)
- Saturday 08:00: Regional races (adult + youth)  
- Sunday 08:00: International races (adult + youth)
- Training races: Available daily (unlimited)

**AI Player Integration:**
- AI players fill empty spots in divisions
- New human players replace AI players in Division 2A
- If Division 2A is full, place in Division 2B
- Maintain competitive balance across all divisions
